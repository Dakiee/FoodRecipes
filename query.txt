VALUES ('Pulled BBQ Chicken Sandwiches','245 mins',' 1 15 ','1','We like any meat we cook to basically fall apart when we eat it. Of course, with chicken it is important to make sure it is cooked all the way through. No medium rare for chicken! If the chicken breasts are frozen, you need to cook it on high for 6 hours. If the chicken is thawed, 4-5 hours on low would cook it through. Of course, your crock pot may vary, so always make sure the chicken is cooked all the way through (the juice is clear) or use a meat thermometer. It should read 165* when put in the thickest part of the meat.');

This parsley infused olive oil is a quick condiment which is wonderful drizzled over soups, bruschetta, grilled foods, and more! | justalittlebitofbacon.com Like my Paprika Infused Olive Oil, this parsley oil is fast to make while adding so much flavor to foods. In fact, this oil is even faster to make! All you need is oil and parsley (and a little salt if you want), a blender, and a container to keep it in. You’ll be done in the time it takes to press the button on your blender.');

Here`s an overview of the steps: First, you grab some creamy Greek yogurt. Whole milk is best. Now, add unsweetened cocoa powder and your favorite sweetener (I use stevia glycerite). Add just a bit of water, especially if your Greek yogurt is very thick. Then, with a spoon, slowly and patiently mix everything together. Once fully mixed, I like to let the mixture sit for about 30 minutes at room temperature. This allows the flavors to meld and it also dissolves any remaining stubborn cocoa powder. Then, I give the yogurt one more stir, and dig in! So since I make this recipe for my after-dinner dessert, I usually make it before we sit down to eat our dinner, then let it rest.');
